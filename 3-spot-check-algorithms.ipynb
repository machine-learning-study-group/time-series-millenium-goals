    "# 3. Spot Check Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "From https://machinelearningmastery.com/process-for-working-through-machine-learning-problems/\n",

    "I use 10 fold cross validation in my test harnesses by default. All experiments (algorithm and dataset combinations) are repeated 10 times and the mean and standard deviation of the accuracy is collected and reported. I also use statistical significance tests to flush out meaningful results from noise. Box-plots are very useful for summarizing the distribution of accuracy results for each algorithm and dataset pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "I spot check algorithms, which means loading up a bunch of standard machine learning algorithms into my test harness and performing a formal experiment. I typically run 10-20 standard algorithms from all the major algorithm families across all the transformed and scaled versions of the dataset I have prepared.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of spot checking is to flush out the types of algorithms and dataset combinations that are good at picking out the structure of the problem so that they can be studied in more detail with focused experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "More focused experiments with well-performing families of algorithms may be performed in this step, but algorithm tuning is left for the next step."
